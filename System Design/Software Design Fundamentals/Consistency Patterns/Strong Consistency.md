Strong consistency is a critical consistency model in distributed systems, prioritizing data integrity above all else. It guarantees that after an update, all nodes reflect that change _before_ any read request is served, ensuring all clients always see the latest data. This is essential for systems where accessing the most current information is paramount. Here's how strong consistency benefits key applications:

- **File Systems:** In distributed file systems, strong consistency ensures all clients see the same, most recent version of a file. This is crucial for collaborative work, preventing conflicts and data loss. For example, when one user saves a document edit, other collaborators should immediately see the updated version.

- **Relational Databases:** Strong consistency is fundamental to the ACID properties of database transactions. It guarantees that all parts of a transaction complete before changes become visible, preventing data corruption from concurrent operations. A bank transfer, for example, relies on strong consistency to ensure the debit and credit occur atomically.

- **Financial Services:** Financial systems absolutely depend on strong consistency. It ensures accurate transaction recording and balance updates, preventing issues like double spending and incorrect balances. The potential financial ramifications of even minor inconsistencies make strong consistency non-negotiable in this domain.
